# PregaCare-Bringing Essential Maternal Care and Bridging Rural Healthcare Gaps with AI in Rural Communities. 
A dedicated platform supporting maternal health in rural areas by providing accessible healthcare resources, guidance, and tools for expecting mothers.
Our platform offers a range of features to support maternal health in rural areas. With **Local Healthcare Access**, mothers can easily locate nearby clinics and midwives through an interactive map. **Vaccine Reminders** ensure timely alerts based on the childâ€™s age, helping parents stay up-to-date on essential vaccinations. The **Diet & Nutrition** feature provides personalized diet guidance, including trimester-based food recommendations in both Hindi and English, with options for audio support. For assessing iron levels, our **Anemia Assessment** tool uses a simple questionnaire to evaluate risk and recommend when to seek medical attention. The **Health Profile** feature allows mothers to track key health details like due dates, blood pressure, daily steps, and more, all in one place. Using **Risk Prediction**, mothers can gain insights into potential pregnancy risks based on their health data. For mental wellness, we offer a **Mental Well-Being** section with blogs focused on prenatal and postnatal care, managing postpartum depression, and other supportive topics.
